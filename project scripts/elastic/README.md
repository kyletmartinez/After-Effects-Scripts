# After Effects Scripts

A collection of helpful scripts for After Effects that run natively or with a 3rd party script launcher..

To run the script natively in After Effects use `File > Script > Run Script File...` and choose this script.

## Scripts

#### [Shift Highlight Layers (v1.0)](/scripts/Shift%20Highlight%20Layers.jsx)

Highlight layers are set up in a grid using sliders for X position and Y Position to
automatically adjust their position. Imagine the sliders indicating which column and row the
highlight should appear on and using math to actually set the position values.

It became cumbersome to adjust groups of highlights individually so this script with adjust all
the selected layers at one time, shifting positions horizontally and vertically based on the
xOffset and yOffset values.

I set the values manually but they could use a prompt() to ask for user input as well.
